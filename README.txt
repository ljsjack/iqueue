iQueue Project README

1.1 Scope of the project

Audience of project : Patrons and stall owners of NUS canteens.
Level of project: Project Gemini (currently)

1.2 What it solves
It solves the issue of long queues and waiting time for food especially during peak hours. 

1.3 Why is it important
As a student in NUS, one may not have the time to queue for their food between their packed schedules. Many students hence find themselves skipping meals or missing out on delicious food due to long queues in the canteen. With this application, we aim to eliminate this hurdle between the students and the food that they crave for. We feel that there is a need to be addressed since it is quite common for students to miss their lunch as they rush for their classes or end up late for lectures due to long queues in canteens.


2.1 Features
The features below are listed according to the priority at which they are to be implemented.

2.1.1 Electronic Queue System
To eliminate the need for a physical queue system, users will be able to “join” in an electronic queue and order their food through the application. The application will give an estimated waiting time for the food to be ready, the user will be given a notification to alert them to collect their food.

2.1.2 Canteen Capacity Estimator
To minimise overcrowding at any canteen at any specific time, our application will display the estimated occupancy rate of each canteen so that users will be able to make an informed decision of where they can go to have their meals and estimate the amount of time spent eating. This will ensure they can manage their timetables better and not be late for lessons and still consume their meal.

2.1.3 Electronic Payment (To be implemented if there is sufficient time, else to be done as a future side project.)
With an electronic payment, a smooth transaction can be made between the patrons and the stall owners. The stall owners will not have to worry about collecting payment and giving out change, thus decreasing the time spent queueing. This will be significant especially during the peak hours.
